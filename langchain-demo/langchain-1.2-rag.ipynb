Following a two-week siege, the city surrendered, but unlike the brutal massacre that accompanied the Crusader conquest in 1099, Saladin offered lenient terms, allowing Christian inhabitants to leave upon payment of a ransom, demonstrating a strategic blend of military prowess and diplomatic magnanimity that solidified his legendary status and deeply shocked Christendom, directly triggering the launch of the Third Crusade.\n"
